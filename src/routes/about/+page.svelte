			Hi, I'm Ze-v De Guzman Jardin. I'm currently a 3rd-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
            in Information Technology at Gordon College.
			Information Technology wasn't my first course choice because my dream was to become a Culinary student, 
            but for some reason, I ended up in technology. 
			Now, my dream is to become a web developer and gain more knowledge about the tech industry. 
			However, I'm not yet confident in my skills and know I still have a lot to learn in IT.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm just a simple guy who enjoys the outdoors, and has a passion for sports like basketball and bowling
             all while cherishing time spent with friends
		</p>

		<p>I am excited about the future and envision myself becoming a web developer in the coming years. 
            This portfolio will showcase my achievements and successes throughout my journey. 
            I believe that nothing is impossibleâ€”have faith, trust in God, and know that you can achieve your goals.
